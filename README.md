# TouchMacros
Inspired by a broken keyboard and the sudden inability to use shortcuts when working with a touchscreen device

This app aims to provide a small tool to emulate different key strokes and allows to use modifiers and key combinations through a graphical button interface without the need for a physical keyboard

### ðŸš§Under developementðŸš§
#### Features so far:
- send keypress events to keyboard focused window
- activate and deactivate modifiers (Shift, Alt, Ctrl,...) through gui buttons
- support for multi-key inputs, eg. Ctrl+Z
- load preset for available buttons from file
- keep window on top
- dynamically adjust button grid depending on window size
- dock window to any screen edge
- dynamically resize other windows on monitor to not overlap
