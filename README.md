# TouchMacros
Inspired by a broken keyboard and the sudden inability to use shortcuts when working with a touchscreen device

This app aims to provide a small tool to emulate different key strokes and allows to use modifiers and key combinations through a graphical button interface without the need for a physical keyboard

### 🚧Under developement🚧

- enable and disable modifiers (shift, alt, ctrl,...) through gui buttons
